Packaging Design
  Stack of cups to be used by each player, filled with dice, and capped off with simple bowl colored to resemble a warhead.
  The bowl serves to keep the dice contained so as to not damage the plastic wrap.
  The stack of cups has 3 fins attached to further the appearance of a rocket.
  A boxed deck of cards is strapped to the side of the cups, and features a picture of a man strapped to the side of a rocket.
  The strap has printed onto it a description of the game.
  The entire thing is plastic wrapped.
